Great! The Trackalyzer application has been successfully implemented and tested. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Created a TypeScript project structure with appropriate configuration
2. Implemented a SQLite database for persistent storage
3. Created models for collections and tasks
4. Built a command-line interface using Commander.js
5. Implemented reporting with chart generation in both Markdown and DOCX formats
6. Added interactive prompts using Inquirer.js
7. Tested all core functionality

The application now provides the following features:
- Creating, listing, choosing, and deleting collections
- Starting, stopping, and deleting tasks
- Tracking time spent on tasks
- Linking tasks to pull requests
- Generating analysis reports in DOCX or Markdown format with charts

The project follows best practices like:
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Error handling throughout the codebase
- Clean separation of concerns with models, commands, and utilities
- User-friendly interactive CLI experience
