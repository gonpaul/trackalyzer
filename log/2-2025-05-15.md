I've successfully updated the code to store generated reports in a dedicated 'reports' directory. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Created a new utility file `fs-helpers.ts` with functions to:
   - Define a consistent 'reports' directory name
   - Ensure the reports directory exists
   - Create collection-specific subdirectories for reports

2. Updated both the DOCX and Markdown report generators to:
   - Use the new reports directory by default
   - Store each collection's reports in its own subdirectory
   - Maintain backward compatibility when a custom path is provided

3. Enhanced the chart generation utility to:
   - Ensure the output directory exists before saving files
   - Create parent directories if needed

4. Updated the collection commands to:
   - Reference the new reports directory in prompts
   - Use the reports directory by default
   - Provide more informative messages

5. Updated the README to include:
   - Information about the reports directory structure
   - A project directory layout for better understanding

These changes improve the application by organizing generated reports in a consistent, predictable location while maintaining flexibility for users who want to specify a custom output location.
