# Trackalyzer

A command-line application for tracking and analyzing work during production practice with a local SQLite database.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trackalyzer.git
cd trackalyzer

# Install dependencies
npm ci 

# Build the project
npm run build

# Link the CLI globally (optional)
npm link
```

## Usage

The application provides commands to manage collections and tasks, and to generate reports.

### Collection Commands

Collections are used to group related tasks.

```bash
# Create a new collection
trackalyzer collection create

# List all collections
trackalyzer collection list

# Choose an active collection
trackalyzer collection choose

# Delete a collection
trackalyzer collection delete

# Analyze the current collection and generate a report
trackalyzer collection analyze
```

### Task Commands

Tasks represent work items that you track.

```bash
# Start a new task
trackalyzer task start

# Stop the current task
trackalyzer task stop

# Delete a task
trackalyzer task delete
```

## Usage Example

The project has a complete example scenario demonstrating how to use Trackalyzer to track work on a web development project. This interactive example guides you through each step of the workflow.

## Features

- Create, list, choose, and delete work collections
- Start, stop, and delete tasks within collections
- Track time spent on tasks
- Link tasks to pull requests
- Generate analysis reports in DOCX or Markdown format
- Visualize time spent with charts

## Data Model

### Collections

Collections organize groups of related tasks.

```
collections {
	id: AUTOINCREMENT,
	name: STRING REQUIRED,
}
```

### Tasks

Tasks represent work items with tracking metadata.

```
tasks {
	id: AUTOINCREMENT,
	collection_id: INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name: String Required,
	description: String Required, 
	pull_request: String,
	start_time: TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIME,
	finish_time: TIMESTAMP
}
```

## Generated Reports

Reports are stored in the `reports` directory by default, with each collection getting its own subdirectory.

Reports include:
- A summary of completed tasks
- Number of tasks and pull requests
- Total hours spent
- Average time per task
- A chart visualization of task durations
- A detailed table of all tasks

## Roadmap and Tasks

The following tasks are planned for future development:

### Completed
- âœ… Create a TypeScript project structure with configuration
- âœ… Implement SQLite database for persistent storage
- âœ… Create models for collections and tasks
- âœ… Build a command-line interface using Commander.js
- âœ… Implement Markdown reporting with chart generation
- âœ… Implement DOCX reporting with chart generation
- âœ… Add interactive prompts using Inquirer.js
- âœ… Create a dedicated reports directory structure
- âœ… Add data visualization with charts

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Fix DOCX table formatting issues (various approaches tried but none fully successful)

### Planned

- ðŸ“‹ Fix docx formatting: currently it can't set columns width properly
- ðŸ“‹ Implement `task list` to display all tasks in a collection
- ðŸ“‹ Add configuration options for default report directory
- ðŸ“‹ Implement export/import functionality for backing up data
- ðŸ“‹ Add filtering options for report generation
- ðŸ“‹ Create a simple web dashboard for viewing reports
- ðŸ“‹ Add user authentication for multi-user support
